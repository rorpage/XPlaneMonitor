XPlaneMonitor is an Android application that interfaces with X-Plane 11.

This app displays flight info about the brakes, flaps, landing gear, 
reverse thrust, G-forces, time and distance to NAV1, without having to 
look around the cockpit.

It also has buttons to turn on and off all lights, and adjust all the 
settings for the EFIS map display. It works with the X-Plane and Zibo 737,
and the Flight Factor 767. It also implements protocol conversion so you
can use the Flight Factor 767 with XHSI displays, which normally doesn't
support the 767.

There is also a moving map showing the current aircraft location.

This app does not need any plugin, it requests everything from an 
X-Plane discovered via BECN broadcasts, and uses the standard UDP 
protocol.

You can download the app directly to your Android device from the Google 
Play store:

This application is open source, written in Kotlin, and released under the GNU Public License 
version 3 (GPLv3).

This is an early prototype and I look forward to feedback on any 
problems. File bugs or comments here on GitHub.
