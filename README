XPlaneMonitor is an Android application that interfaces with X-Plane 11.

This app displays flight info about the brakes, flaps, landing gear,
reverse thrust, G-forces, time and distance to NAV1, without having to
look around the cockpit.

It also has buttons to turn on and off all lights, and adjust all the
settings for the EFIS map display. It works with most X-Plane 11
aircraft, including the default 737/747, Zibo's 738, SSG's 747, and many
others. It also implements protocol conversion so you can use the Flight
Factor 767 with XHSI displays, which normally doesn't support the 767.

There is also a moving map showing the current aircraft location.

XPlaneMonitor will auto-detect your X-Plane instance assuming that
multicast is working. Many routers do not support multicast properly,
and so you can tap on the Auto BECN button to configure a manual X-Plane
hostname or IP address.

You must have the ExtPlane v2 plugin installed in your X-Plane 11
Resources/plugins directory. This plugin uses port 51000 to provide
external control capabilities, so you must make sure that Windows
firewall is not blocking it. You must download the binaries for the
plugin from http://waynepiekarski.net/extplane - you cannot use the
original ExtPlane v1 plugin because it has bugs related to string
datarefs.

The source code is available under GPLv3 at
https://github.com/waynepiekarski/XPlaneMonitor - it is written in
Kotlin and is built with Android Studio. The plugin source code is
https://github.com/waynepiekarski/ExtPlane and is forked from the
original code at https://github.com/vranki/ExtPlane (licensed under
GPLv3).

This is an early prototype and I look forward to feedback on any
problems. Visit the GitHub page to file bugs
https://github.com/waynepiekarski/XPlaneMonitor

Remember: extract the plugin from http://waynepiekarski.net/extplane
into your Resources/plugins directory, and make sure port 51000 is not
blocked by the Windows firewall.
